# Euphonium
google maps for stud game

# Huh?
If you're here, you most likely know about Baritone, the Minecraft pathfinding bot. Since Roblox has A* literally built in, I decided to make Euphonium (a real life instrument that's like the baritone).

# How does it work?
Just A*, so read up on that. As of right now, it really really sucks.

From my current testing, it struggles with elevated platforms (so like ramps), but is good at exploiting hitboxes, like so good that it looks like it's flying, work smarter not harder ig.

Don't worry, I'm gonna keep working on it.

# Planned Features

- Better ladder support
- Swimming support
- Do it in sections like Baritone (so do one part, calculate near end of part to the next part, until you reach the goal)
- Make the path lines last longer
- HologramMode (allows you to simply see the path so you can follow it yourself instead of the bot, maybe)
- Player follow
- Fix ramp issues
- Fix death bugs
- Grab piece/object ID and use for future use (so you get an ID of like a key, come back, you then have Euphonium to just go get it)
- Moving Platform Detection
- Import/Export Paths (your friend has the perfect line for an obby, but you're too lazy to have Euphonium fully calculate it, so he just sends you it instead)
- TP Detection
- Keyboard Shortcuts
